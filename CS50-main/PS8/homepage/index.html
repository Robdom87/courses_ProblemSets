            <p id="Blob1">Hello everyone, yo soy Roberto Dominguez, and i am also the best man.
                </p>
            <p id="Blob1">I met miguel late middle school as he moved from florida. And worked with him on a couple of projects in high school for mr Gs class. I liked Miguel. he was consistent with group projects and he had the confidence that made him a natural leader. But it wasnt until our first years in college where I truly got to know him.
                </p>
            <p id="Blob1">And Miguels is the type of dude to advocate push a movement within Gammas and drop all of it for a girl. I mean that girl is wife today, so fair dues. RIP single gamma movement. Miguel is the type of due where you ask for some help for some interviews and not only does he prep you for the interview, but when you actually get in he offers that you stay at his grandmas place for the internship. Mama rita, lencho, diana muchicismimas gracias por hospedarme, se las debo todavia. Miguel is the type of dude to come to you with a great company idea and proceed to bring together a team of amazing people and actually make it happen. Will Jesse, we out here! Miguel is the type of dude that makes me proud to call him one of my best friends.
                </p>
            <p id="Blob1">I guess what im trying to say is Marriage is a beautiful thing but it can also be hard. But if anyone can do it, its miguel. Elizabeth youre in great hands. Im rooting for you two. por los recien casados!
