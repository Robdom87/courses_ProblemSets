Hash- key value pairs - fast for finding and removing values
js can only use strings as the key

good hash needs to be fast
dsitributes hash unformly
deterministic of same inpits lead to same output
table length of prime number, leads to way less collisions

can solve collisions
with lested array
or linear probings - add to the nearest open slot

duplicate keys, typically overwrite

insert, deletion, access is big O of 1
